# How to run this program:

1. call pip install -r requirements.txt to download required packages

2. call python urlapi.py to start the main program

3. the program will offer 6 options to you. Three of the options (a, c, d) will parse the output for you, with c and d doubling and halving the ingredients, respectively. The other three options will transform the recipe by substituting ingredients into the recipe. Then, you can navigate the recipe by using the letters or basic phrases to get the ingredients, methods, tools, or steps, or ask questions. When navigating steps, you may read the steps all at once or one at a time; you can move through steps by saying "next step","forward", "previous step", or "backward", or by specifying a specific step number. Finally, you can ask both vague questions, specific "how to" or "what is" questions, or questions about the quantities of ingredients.
